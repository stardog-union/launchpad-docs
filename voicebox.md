# Voicebox

[Stardog Voicebox](https://docs.stardog.com/voicebox/) is a conversational AI chat interface for your Enterprise Data. This document provides instructions for using Voicebox within Launchpad.

Launchpad can operate with or without the Voicebox. To enable Voicebox, youâ€™ll need to run an additional Docker image ([Voicebox Service](#voicebox-service)) and provide its address to Launchpad. The two services communicate over HTTP.

## Using Voicebox Programmatically

You can interact with Voicebox programmatically using the Launchpad REST API. This allows you to send queries to Voicebox and receive responses in a structured format, which can be useful for integrating Voicebox functionality into other applications or workflows.

In order to use the Voicebox REST APIs, you *must* have the [Voicebox Service](#voicebox-service) running and configured with Launchpad. You can access the REST API documentation served by Launchpad at `/api/v1/docs` endpoint. There's a Swagger UI that provides an interactive interface to explore the API endpoints. Additional documentation about how to use the API is contained there.

### Creating a Voicebox Application and Associated API Key

To use the Voicebox REST API, you need to create a Voicebox application in Launchpad and generate an API key that is scoped to that application. This API key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Voicebox REST API:

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a Voicebox application. In the bottom left corner of the Launchpad UI, click on your username opening the user menu, then click on **Manage API Keys**.

![Manage API Keys](./assets/user-voicebox-api-keys.png)

2. Click on **New Voicebox App** and fill in the details for your application. It will ask you to scope the application with details such as the connection to use, database, model, etc.

![Create Voicebox App Dialog](./assets/create-voicebox-app-dialog.png)

3. Once the application is created, you will need to create an API key that is scoped to the Voicebox application. Click on **New App Key** in the Voicebox application you just created. You can provide a name for the API key, and adjust the expiration date if desired.

![Create Voicebox App Key Dialog](./assets/create-voicebox-app-dialog.png)

4. After creating the API key, you will be able to copy it only once. This API key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Voicebox REST API.

![Copy Voicebox App Key Dialog](./assets/copy-voicebox-app-api-key-dialog.png)

The API key should be provided in the `Authorization` header of your requests as a *Bearer* token. You must also include a `X-Client-Id` header with an identifier < 255 characters long that identifies a user of the Voicebox application. This can be any alphanumeric string.


```
# Voicebox App token
token=sdc_xyz...

curl --silent -X 'POST' \
  'http://launchpad.local:8080/api/v1/voicebox/ask' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Client-Id: someones-id' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "Who is Cersei Lannister married to?"
}' | jq '{ "Result": .result, "SPARQL Query Used": (.actions[] | select(.type == "sparql") | .value)}'
{
  "Result": "Cersei Lannister is married to [Robert Baratheon](urn:stardog:marketplace:demos:got:characters:901).",
  "SPARQL Query Used": "# Who is Cersei Lannister married to?\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?spouse0 \nWHERE {\n  ?character0 a got:Character . \n  ?character0 stardog:label \"Cersei Lannister\" . \n  ?character0 got:spouse ?spouse0 . \n  ?spouse0 a got:Character . \n  FILTER ( ?character0 != ?spouse0)\n}"
}
```

### Stardog Authentication for API Requests

When making API requests to the Voicebox REST API, the Voicebox Service makes requests to Stardog in order to answer your question. There is a Stardog credential associated with the Voicebox application by means of the Launchpad connection you selected when creating the Voicebox application. In some cases, you may need to override the default authentication method used by Launchpad.

The authentication method depends on your Stardog connection type:

#### Username/Password Connections

When you authenticate through the Launchpad interface (create a new connection), Launchpad obtains a JWT from the Stardog server on behalf of the authenticated user and persists it beyond the Launchpad session for subsequent requests. If you try and use the connection in Launchpad and your token is invalid or expired, Launchpad will prompt you to re-authenticate, obtaining a new JWT and persisting it for future use. This means that it is possible for a JWT associated with the connection to expire when using it programmatically and not through the Launchpad UI since you will not be prompted to re-authenticate.

If you encounter authentication errors or want to ensure you always have a valid token for programmatic requests, you can manually retrieve a fresh token from the Stardog server associated with the Voicebox app's connection using the `/admin/token` endpoint ([as described below](#manual-token-retrieval-from-stardog)) and include it in your requests using the `X-SD-Auth-Token` header to override the stored credential. You could also log 
into Launchpad and re-authenticate the connection to obtain a new JWT, but this is not always practical for programmatic use.

#### SSO Connections

SSO connections (such as Microsoft Entra) require manual token management since Launchpad does not persist JWTs from external identity providers beyond the session. For these connections, you must:

1. **Obtain a valid token** from your SSO provider that Stardog is configured to accept
2. **Include the token** in your API requests using the `X-SD-Auth-Token` header

##### Token Override Capability

The `X-SD-Auth-Token` header can also override any JWT that Launchpad has persisted for a connection. This is particularly useful for ensuring you always have a valid, unexpired token.

###### Manual Token Retrieval from Stardog

As noted earlier, if Stardog is configured to issue JWTs, you can manually retrieve a token using the `/admin/token` endpoint. This is useful for obtaining a fresh token when needed.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -u <username>:<password> https://<stardog-server-url>/admin/token \
```

The returned JWT issued by Stardog can then be included in your Voicebox API requests:

```bash
X-SD-Auth-Token: <your-jwt-token>
```

> [!TIP]
> If using the Stardog CLI, you can also use the [`stardog-admin user token`](https://docs.stardog.com/stardog-admin-cli-reference/user/user-token) command to obtain a JWT from Stardog for a user.

## Voicebox Service

The Voicebox Service is distributed as a Docker image. The Voicebox Service is a stateless HTTP server that packages up Stardog Voicebox functionality. It is intended to be run in conjunction with Stardog Launchpad. The Voicebox Service will communicate directly with whichever Stardog servers you are interacting with in Launchpad, so they should be accessible to this image when run as a container.

![Voicebox Service with Launchpad Architecuture](./assets/voicebox-service-architecture.png)

### Running the Voicebox Service

1. Similar to Launchpad, the Voicebox Service image can be pulled from Stardog's private Docker registry.

   ```bash
   docker pull stardog-stardog-apps.jfrog.io/voicebox-service:current
   ```

   - The `current` tag will always point to the latest version of the Voicebox Service. You can also specify a specific version tag to avoid accidental upgrades.

2. To run the Voicebox Service with Docker, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run \
   --env-file .env.voicebox-service \
   -p 8000:8000 \
   -v /host/path/to/vbx-config.json:/voicebox-config/vbx-config.json \
   stardog-stardog-apps.jfrog.io/voicebox-service:current
   ```

   - `.env.voicebox-service` can be named anything but contains the configuration for the Voicebox Service. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more details.
   - `/host/path/to/vbx-config.json` is mounted from the host to `/voicebox-config/vbx-config.json` in the container. This configuration has more LLM specific configuration.
      - `.env.voicebox-service` should have `VBX_CONFIG_FILE=/voicebox-config/vbx-config.json` in it.
   - The Voicebox Service HTTP server is exposed on port 8000 so Launchpad can communicate with it.

3. Update Launchpad configuration to point to URL of the Voicebox Service.

   ```bash
   VOICEBOX_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://<host>:8000
   ```

4. Assuming you have restarted Launchpad with the Voicebox Service endpoint configured, you should be able to access Voicebox from the Launchpad UI.

| `llm_provider` | `openai` |
| `llm_name` | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `server_url` | (Optional - can be set if OpenAI endpoint is access via proxy)  |

It is also possible to provide optional custom HTTP headers included in the OpenAI requests. Here is an example configuration file showing how these custom headers can be configured:

```json
{  
    "default_llm_config": {    
        "llm_provider": "openai",
        "llm_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "server_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/",
        "provider_args": {
          "headers" : {
        "OpenAI-Organization": "org-gnSjNrpIz0bb7V1modfLrNof",
        "OpenAI-Project": "$PROJECT_ID"
          }
        } 
    }
}
```

The values for custom headers should be valid [Python string templates](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings). The variables mentioned in template string should be defined as environment variables, e.g. in the above example there should be an environment variable named `PROJECT_ID`. Environment variables is a better choice for including sensitive values in the configuration file whereas non-sensitive values can be directly included in the configuration file, e.g. organization value in the above example.

The following environment variables are used with OpenAI.

| Environment Variable | **Required** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `Y` | OpenAI API key |
