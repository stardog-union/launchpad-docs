# onprem-configs

This repository contains documentation and examples configurations for the On-Prem Stardog Portal.

## Overview

On-Prem is a login service for a __single__ Stardog instance for access to Stardog Applications (Studio, Explorer, Designer). With the right configurations for On-Prem and
the Stardog server itself, a user can access their Stardog server via:

- [Basic Auth (Stardog username and password)](./basic/)
- Kerberos
- [Google SSO](./google/)
- Keycloak SSO

## How it Works

There are 2 main flows (Kerberos being the exception) used by the On-Prem application with respect to authentication.

1. Basic Auth (Stardog username and password)
2. Identity Provider (e.g. Google)

Both authentication flows utilize Stardog's [OAuth 2.0 Integration](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/security/oauth-integration). In short, Stardog can produce JWT tokens it can then accept for authenticated API requests. Stardog can also be configured to accept JWT tokens issued by a trusted issuer and optionally auto-create users if roles from the IdP are mapped properly to pre-defined Stardog roles.

```

## Get Started

1. Login in to the Docker registry:

    ```
    docker login stardog-stardog-apps.jfrog.io
    ```

2. Pull the latest image:

    ```
    docker pull stardog-stardog-apps.jfrog.io/cloud-login:onprem-current
    ```

3. Configure the Stardog server as needed and create a configuration for On-Prem.

> **Note**:
> Example configurations are provided in this repository.

4. Create and run the container.

    ```
    docker run \
      --env-file .env \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      --rm \
      --name stardog-apps \
      stardog-stardog-apps.jfrog.io/cloud-login:onprem-current
    ```

    - On-Prem will always be served at port `8080` from the container. Map this port as needed.

## Configuration Options

All available configuration options are listed in the table below:
